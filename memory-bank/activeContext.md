# Active Context

This document details the current work focus, recent changes, next steps, and active decisions and considerations for the mcp-newsapi project.

## Current Work Focus:
Implementing the core logic for the News API tools and updating documentation.

## Recent Changes:
- Implemented the core logic for the `search_articles` (Everything) tool in `src/tools/everything.ts`.
- Implemented the core logic for the `get_top_headlines` (Top Headlines) tool in `src/tools/topHeadlines.ts`.
- Updated `memory-bank/progress.md` to reflect completed tool implementation.

## Next Steps:
- Finalize comprehensive documentation in `README.md`.
- Ensure all memory bank files are up to date.
- Prepare for testing the implemented tools.

## Active Decisions and Considerations:
- The project will closely mirror the structure and dependencies of the `mcp-indicators` project.
- Secure handling of the News API key will be a priority during implementation.
- Error handling will be based on the News API documentation.
