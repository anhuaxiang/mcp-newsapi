# Progress

This document tracks what is currently working in the mcp-newsapi project, what is left to build, the current status, and any known issues.

## What Works:
- The basic project structure is set up.
- Core memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) have been initialized.
- Initial configuration files (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `eslint.config.js`, `.prettierrc`, `.gitignore`) are created.
- Placeholder server entry point (`src/index.ts`) and tool index (`src/tools/index.ts`) are created.
- Placeholder tool files for "Everything" (`src/tools/everything.ts`) and "Top Headlines" (`src/tools/topHeadlines.ts`) are created with basic structure and input schemas.
- TypeScript type errors related to missing type definitions for `newsapi` and `process` have been resolved.
- The project builds successfully (`npm run build`).

## What's Left to Build:
- Write comprehensive documentation in `README.md`.

## Current Status:
The core logic for the tool handlers (`src/tools/everything.ts`, `src/tools/topHeadlines.ts`), including API key handling and basic error handling, has been implemented. The project builds successfully. The next phase is to finalize documentation and ensure memory bank files are up to date.

## Known Issues:
- No known issues at this stage.
