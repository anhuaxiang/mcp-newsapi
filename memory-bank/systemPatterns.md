# System Patterns

This document outlines the system architecture, key technical decisions, design patterns in use, and component relationships within the mcp-newsapi project.

## Architecture:
The project is structured as an MCP server, exposing News API functionalities as tools. It will follow a modular design, with each News API endpoint implemented as a separate tool module.

## Key Technical Decisions:
- Use TypeScript for type safety and code maintainability.
- Utilize the News API Node.js SDK for interacting with the News API.
- Implement input validation using Zod.
- Utilize the MCP framework for tool exposure and communication.
- Securely handle the News API key, likely through environment variables or MCP server configuration.

## Design Patterns:
- **Module Pattern:** Each News API endpoint will be encapsulated within its own tool module.
- **Adapter Pattern:** The tool handlers will act as adapters between the MCP tool interface and the News API SDK.

## Component Relationships:
- **MCP Server:** The main component that hosts and exposes the News API tools.
- **Tool Modules:** Individual modules for each News API endpoint, containing the logic for calling the SDK and formatting the output.
- **News API SDK:** The library used to make requests to the News API.
- **Tool Definitions:** Metadata defining the input and output schemas for each News API tool.
