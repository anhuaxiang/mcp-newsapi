# Product Context

This document describes the purpose of the mcp-newsapi project, the problems it solves, how it should work, and the user experience goals.

## Purpose:
The primary purpose of this project is to provide a set of reliable and easy-to-use tools for accessing news data from the News API within the Model Context Protocol (MCP) framework.

## Problems Solved:
- Provides a standardized way to fetch news articles using the News API.
- Enables integration with various applications and workflows through the MCP.
- Simplifies the process of incorporating news data into other tools or analyses.

## How it Should Work:
The project should expose the main News API endpoints ("Everything" and "Top Headlines") as individual MCP tools. Users should be able to call these tools with relevant parameters (e.g., keywords, sources, categories) and receive news article data as output. The tools should handle API communication, authentication, and error reporting.

## User Experience Goals:
- Users should find it easy to understand and use the provided MCP tools.
- The tools should be performant and return news results quickly.
- Documentation for each tool should be clear and comprehensive.
- Handling of API keys should be secure and straightforward for the user.
